# Platform cooperativism and digital education
_Investigating the possibilities of platform cooperativism for digital education_

This repository currently serves to group together a collection of resources about platform cooperativism and digital education - but could be much more. It was created while working on an assignment on these issues, written in April 2018 as part of the [Digital Education in Global Context](http://online.education.ed.ac.uk/course/digital-education-global-context) course on the [online MSc in Digital Education](http://online.education.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

It is very much a work in progress!
