# Platform cooperativism and digital education
_Investigating the possibilities of platform cooperativism for digital education_

This repository currently serves to group together a collection of resources about platform cooperativism and digital education - but could be much more. It was created while working on an assignment on these issues, written in April 2018 as part of the [Digital Education in Global Context](http://online.education.ed.ac.uk/course/digital-education-global-context) course on the [online MSc in Digital Education](http://online.education.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). It is very much a work in progress!

It is primarily inspired by a 2016 paper entitled [_Towards a radical digital citizenship in digital education_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17508487.2016.1234494), written by Akwugo Emejulu & Callum McGregor. As they argue:

> ‘...there is need for a radical digital citizenship...praxis through which individuals and groups: (1) critically analyse the social, political, economic and environmental consequences of technologies in everyday life; (2) collectively deliberate and take action to build alternative and emancipatory technologies and technological practices.’
[(Emejulu and McGregor 2016: 1)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17508487.2016.1234494)

When a [public lecture, given at the University of Edinburgh in May 2017 centred around the above paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKkS1Y-uvHs) briefly mentioned platform cooperativism, I was compelled to think further about the ways in which it might allow us to create, as [Emejulu and McGregor (2016: 1)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17508487.2016.1234494) put it, 'alternative and emancipatory technologies and technological practices' - free from the constraints of [platform capitalism](https://platform.coop/about). My interest in [platform cooperativism](https://platform.coop/about) began when I discovered the book [_Ours to Hack and to Own_](http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/ours-to-hack-and-to-own/) (edited by Trebor Scholz and Nathan Scheider), and I am keen to see how this collective and cooperative approach might be used in digital education to design and create these alternative spaces using techniques such as '[inclusive codesign](https://github.com/mwolfindale/platform-cooperativism-and-digital-education/blob/master/inclusive-codesign.md)'.
